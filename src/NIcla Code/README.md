# Nicla Vision Code

The code is explained in the main readme file. 

Just for you though, Ill vaguely explain it here as well
The code consists of one main function and inside of that there are multiple functions

- cameraConfig is a higher order function that sets up the camera and takes a picture 
- â€¢	find_color_blobs gets the amount of pixels in a all color blobs and sends back 0 for green or 1 for red, depending on how many pixels are found for each color.
- Send info simply sends a value, (0 or 1) to the specified address
- I recommend greatly that you look at the code, there are multiple comments that get into more detail on the integration
