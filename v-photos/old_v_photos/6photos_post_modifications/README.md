# Vehicle Pictures Post Modifications

While practicing over the week our team encountered multiple problems
1. The rigid cables were burnt and were not transmitting voltage/current well
2. The on/off switch had the same problem (although the reason is still only a theory)
3. The Battery was not charging
4. The Voltage regulator was not working

Due to this we had to change multiple things on the robot that can be seen in the new pictures

- We changed the battery so you might notice there are different cables for the battery now (the zip tie is also different)
- We changed the rigid cables to thicker bigger cables that could handle more voltage/current
- We replaced the voltage regulator
- We changed the on/off switch (you can see the zip tie is different)
